# Project description:
As part of Operating System class I implemented a shell-like application written in C language.
Functionalities that have been implemented:
 - accepts user commands from command line. The interpreter will expose a specific prompt showing that it is prepared to accept a user command
 - offers a "help" command, which lists all available commands with implemented options
 - offers a "history" command
 - "cat" command with parameters: -b -E -n -s
 - "head" with parameters: -c, -n, -q, -v
 - "env" command with the -u parameter
 (the implemented commands have the same functionality as the OS defined commands)
